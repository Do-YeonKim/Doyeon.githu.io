<p>Passionate microbiologist with a focus on human microbiomes and their associated viruses. As a PhD candidate at Kyung Hee University, I blend rigorous research skills with a growing expertise in scientific communication.

My current focus is completing my PhD while exploring the intersection of microbiology and scientific publishing. I'm keen to leverage my research experience and passion for clear scientific communication in a future role as a scientific editor.

I'm open to networking with professionals in microbiology and scientific publishing, opportunities in scientific editing and research communication, and collaborations in microbiome and virome research.</p>
